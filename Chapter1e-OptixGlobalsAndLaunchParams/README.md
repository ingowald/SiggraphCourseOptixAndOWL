- add 'optixLaunchParams' - mention (required) name for that.

- devcode: raygen remains raygen, but rather than using raygen program
  data from sbt we use otpixGlobals.

- create laumchparams - same way, just no mod and entrypoint

all owlRayGenSet become owlParamsSet ...

- owlRayGenLaunch becomes owlLauch (no 'Params' in there - this is the
  preferred/recommended way!)
